Welcome to my Github! My name is Lucas and I'm excited about pretty much anything that is data or software related. Data science and software engineering are pretty distinct fields, but...why not "git" you a person that can do both :) I know that was bad.

If this is your first time here, here's a brief summary of my projects in no particular order:

- crop_yield_pipeline: This is a data ETL pipeline in Python that uses the Requests framework to query NOAA/USDA RESTful APIs for weather, soil, and crop data. 
I perform basic data preprocessing such as null value replacement, standardization of Gaussian values, and table merging. This data is stored internally within Python
and intended to be ingested into a machine learning algorithm for crop yield prediction.
- kaggle_projects: This repo is a collection of my Kaggle Python projects grouped here for convenience. Currently, it contains the following projects:
  - suspicious-transaction-detection: A fraud transaction detection machine learning model using gradient boosting and K-best features
  - wildfire-ignition-point-prediction: A wildfire prediction machine learning model using GradientBoostingRegressor and one-hot encoding
- tableau_dashboard_collection: A collection of my data visualization work in Tableau, such as Apple stock trends, CO2 emissions, optimal hospital location, etc.
- tictactoe_AI: A game of TicTacToe in C++ that lets you play against a fellow human or a built-in AI. Note that you will absolutely need Windows for this.
- storage: C implementations of dynamic storage operations.
- olfactory: A MATLAB Perceptron linear classifier model trained on locust antennae behavior data, that predicts locusts' reaction to certain types of stimuli.
- Luo_Rudy_model: Produced as part of my graduate research project related to computational cardiac models, this is A MATALB single cell and 1D cable simulation of the 1991 Luo-Rudy(LR1) cardiac model.

- openCARP_experiments: This is my ongoing research project using openCARP(www.opencarp.org), a C++ open-source cardiac simulation program with a Python interface. I am developing new cardiac computational models with this platform, and aim to produce a written thesis using optimization techniques(like Newton's method, gradient descent, etc.) to obtain optimal physiological parameters.
